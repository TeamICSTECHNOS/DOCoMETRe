<h1>Timing consideration</h1>

<p>
With Arduino Uno systems, the real time loop precision is not so good. It means that timing control
is not so precise as we could expect because a slow but stable time drift is occuring. Main reason comes from the fact that micros()
instruction takes at less 1<span>&#181;</span>s (see <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/micros/">here</a> for more info) :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1<span>&#181;</span>s with Portenta family</li>
  <li>4<span>&#181;</span>s with 16MHz Arduino boards </li>
  <li>8<span>&#181;</span>s with 8MHz Arduino boards </li>
</ul>
<p>
These values are not so big but for a long time running operation, drift could grow up to more than several milliseconds. If you cannot deal with this timing drift,
please consider to use Portenta Machine Control or ADWin Systems. I've not been able to see any timing drift with ADWin Systems for real time loop running several minutes.
