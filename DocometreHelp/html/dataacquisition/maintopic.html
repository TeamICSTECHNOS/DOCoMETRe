	<p>The ADWinPro comes with its own programming environment. The
		language used, ADBasic, is used to communicate with the various
		modules installed to acquire and generate signals, as well as for
		real-time processing. It is therefore entirely possible to use this
		language to carry out an experiment.</p>
	<p>However, this language is still difficult to use for people who
		are new to industrial computing and electronics, and costly in terms
		of development time because it has to be reprogrammed for each
		experimental configuration.</p>
	<p>We have therefore developed software within the laboratory to
		enable all its staff, students, researchers and engineers, to
		configure this acquisition system in the best possible conditions so
		that it best meets their experimental needs. This software enables
		motion to be acquired and possibly disturbed, according to criteria
		defined graphically by the user (see DOCoMETRe presentation).</p>
	<p>When using DOCoMETRe, the only principle to bear in mind that
		has a direct link with ADWinPro is the operation of its real-time
		loop. There are then several steps to follow, most of which are taken
		directly from the management of an experimental protocol:</p>
